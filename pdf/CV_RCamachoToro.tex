\resheading{Main selected publications}

In this section I want to give an overview of my scientific activities to allow the reviewers to have a better insight into the list of publication below. I am an experimental particle physicist working at the \href{http://atlas.ch/}{\color{blue}{ATLAS experiment}} of the Large Hadron Collider (\href{http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider}{\color{blue}{LHC}}) at \href{http://home.cern/}{\color{blue}{CERN}}. The ATLAS Collaboration consists of around 3000 researchers and engineers from 38 countries and this is why our papers and conferences notes are signed by all the collaborators, you will see ``ATLAS Collaboration'' very often in the author field. I have more than 200 papers published as ATLAS author but below you will see a selected list of publications where I had a major/leading/coordination contribution. 

The LHC is the most powerful machine ever built on earth, a 27 km ring that accelerates protons to a speed close to the speed of light and collides them. In each of this energetic collisions (we have around one billion of collisions per second!) we recreate the conditions at the beginning of the universe, little Big Bangs. ATLAS investigates many different types of physics that might become detectable in the energetic collisions of the LHC. Some of members of the collaboration work on confirmations or improved measurements of the Standard Model theory like the recently discovered Higgs boson, also known as God particle. Others look for possible clues for new physical theories that explains all the nature unknowns like the existence of Dark Matter and Dark Energy that makes up for 95\% of the know universe. And many others work in making sure the detector works and is taking data or developing new instruments to upgrade the current system. In my case I work on analyzing data to look for new physics clues and on R\&D of silicon particle detectors (project known as Inner Tracker detector) and online event selection system (project known as global Feature EXtractor, gFEX) for the upgrade of our detector for future accelerator runs which is critical, as we will be collecting data from particle collisions at a much higher rate than ever before. The publications listed below are related to this work.
